Telecom churn Prediction Analysis.
In this project, I have analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, builded predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. I have used jupyter notebook IDE from Anaconda navigator. Imported necessary libraries which were required throughout the analysis and modelling. Used markdown texts and comments where necessary.
